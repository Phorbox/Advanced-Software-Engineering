# Advanced-Software-Engineering
A api/web app inventory management system.


I made this for my Advanced software engineering class.

To use this, download the repository. Change to the directory with docker-compose.yml, and use docker compose to build the containers (docker compose up). Connect to the site through localhost. The  landing will have a list of links to use.
